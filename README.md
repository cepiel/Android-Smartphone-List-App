Info

This app shows several different Smartphones and their specs. Practices utilizing listViews, 
custom Adapters, context menus, drawable images, and several different activities and intents. 
You can scroll through the list and click on a phone, which will bring up a bigger picture of the phone.
Clicking that picture will bring you to a browser with the company's website opening for that phone.
Clicking the back arrow will take you back to the list of phones. 

Long-clicking a list item will bring up some options. You can go to another activity by clicking "Specifications"
which shows you more details about that phone. Clicking "Big Picture" will show you a large picture of the phone, 
just like when you normally click the list item. Clicking "Website" will take you to the manufacturer's website 
for that phone.
